                    <p>There is not much relation between what type of developer you are and your work life balance.

                        I am a Full-Stack developer and I have a proper work life balance. I start of at 2:30PM and work
                        till
                        5AM or 5:30 PM, just like all other FrontEnd and BackEnd developers.

                        In Agile environment, I will take up FE card today and a BE card tomorrow. FrontEnd developer
                        will
                        take
                        FE card today, tomorrow and day after. BackEnd developer will take BE card today tomorrow until
                        he
                        become a Full-Stack developer.

                        This is the only difference. Just because I know more technologies or languages doesn’t mean
                        that I
                        need
                        to work harder or more.</p>

                <h1>About Jhankar Mahbub</h1>
                <p>Jhangkar Mahbub started writing at a very young age. It started by drawing on the walls of the house,
                    on the pages of the sisters' books or on the body of the father while he was asleep. However,
                    attempts to force the author's infinite talent to flourish were thwarted step by step. One of these
                    obstacles was the complaints of the sisters to the mother, the sleeping pillow, the gossip of the
                    home teacher, the deception of the questions in the annual examination. Even then, by pointing the
                    finger at these obstacles, the writer was able to move freely in almost all branches of culture. The
                    writer wisely said- there was wandering. Because now there is no wandering. Moreover, not being able
                    to take advantage of writing poems, novels, stories or essays, he started writing about programming
                    as a last resort.
                    <!-- BUET's Industrial and Production Engineering Department has stolen a lot of time from the life of
                    the writer who was given to the cultural arena. The rest is taken from a master's degree in computer
                    science at North Dakota State University. And now to raise money to call home from abroad, Himshim
                    Khan says, Kamla works as a senior web developer at the Nielsen Company in Chicago, USA. -->
